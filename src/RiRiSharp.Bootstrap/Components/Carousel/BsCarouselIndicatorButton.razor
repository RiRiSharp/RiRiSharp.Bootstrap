@* The attribute data-bs-target is added because some styling is dependent on it, even though we are trying to do everything with C#/Js interop
   We add data-bs-slide-to becuase the JS needs to know which slide this corresponds to. We can create our own attribute, but why do that when already one exists fitted for this purpose. *@
